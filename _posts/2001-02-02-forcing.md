The first phase of OMIP will use the version 1.5 of the JRA55-do dataset for
years 1958-2022, as published by [Tsujino et al., 2018](/references).

A new dataset for forcing the ocean is under development at NCAR by Steve
Yeager and Gokhan Dabasoglu based on the ERA5. The is a plan for maintaining
this dataset as ERA evolves. OMIP will transition to this new dataset once it
is released.

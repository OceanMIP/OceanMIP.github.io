The Ocean Model Intercomparison Project (OMIP) for CMIP7 aims to provide a framework for evaluating, understanding, and improving numerical models of ocean circulation, sea-ice, ocean tracer distributions, and biogeochemical cycles.

This is the latest installment of OMIP. The physical part of OMIP has been organized in the past by the Ocean Model Development Panel (OMDP) of the WCRP core program Climate and Ocean Variability, Predictability, and Change (CLIVAR). Prior to OMIP, the OMDP developed the Coordinated Ocean–ice Reference Experiments (COREs) framework and comprehensively assessed the performance of global ocean–sea-ice models ([Griffies et al., 2009, 2014](/references); [Danabasoglu et al., 2014, 2016](/references); [Downes et al., 2015](/references); [Farneti et al., 2015](/references); [Wang et al., 2016a, b](/references); [Ilicak et al., 2016](/references); [Tseng et al., 2016](/references); [Rahaman et al., 2020](/references)). CORE has successfully evolved into phase 1 of the physical part of OMIP (OMIP-1).

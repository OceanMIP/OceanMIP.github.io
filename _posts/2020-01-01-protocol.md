The protocol will largely follow that outlined in [Griffies et al., 2016](/references).

We are considering adjustments to:
- The calculation of atmosphere-ocean surface stress based on the wind speed relative to the ocean (the “eddy-killing” effect is a function of spatial resolution and might be specified as part of the new protocol).
- The salinity restoring protocol (variation in restoring rates between models in the past has led to different implied hydrologic cycles).

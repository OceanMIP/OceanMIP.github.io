These are the source files for [OMIP](https://OceanMIP.github.io).

If you need to build locally, then you will need jekyll to be installed. Otherwise, just edit pages under "_posts" using markdown. Commit and push to "main".

Entries in `_posts` are dated and displayed in latest-first order. It's clunky, I know.
